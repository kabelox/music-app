                <p>About
                    Abel Makkonen Tesfaye (born February 16, 1990), known professionally as the Weeknd, is a Canadian
                    singer, songwriter, and record producer.[1] He began his recording career in 2010, anonymously
                    uploading several songs to YouTube. A year later, the Weeknd released the mixtapes House of
                    Balloons, Thursday, and Echoes of Silence, and quickly earned a following and critical recognition
                    from several mainstream publications due to his dark style of R&B and the mystique surrounding his
                    identity.[2]

                    In 2012, the Weeknd signed with Republic Records, and re-released the mixtapes as part of the
                    compilation album Trilogy (2012). His debut studio album, Kiss Land, was released in 2013.

                <p>Usher entered the fame game at age 14, two years after he moved with his mother and brother to
                    Atlanta. After performing on Star Search, Usher landed a recording contract with LaFace Records. He
                    released his first album in 1994, at age 15. For more than 15 years, Usher has dominated the
                    airwaves, releasing such albums as Confessions (2004), which sold more than 1 million copies in its
                    first week. In June 2012, he produced the album Looking 4 Myself, which found a No. 1 spot on
                    Billboard's albums chart. Usher's songs have repeatedly landed at No. 1 on the charts, earning him
                    several Grammy and People's Choice awards, among other honors.

                    Early Years
                    Usher Terry Raymond IV was born on October 14, 1978, in Dallas, Texas and raised in Chattanooga,
                    Tennessee. He began singing in his church choir when he was six years old. Two years after moving
                    with his mother and brother to Atlanta, Usher performed on the hit show Star Search, and landed a
                    recording contract with LaFace Records soon after. He released his first, self-titled album in 1994,
                    at age 15. Usher soon became known for his polished vocals, broad vocal range, chic style, sexy
                    dance moves and sensual ballads.</p>
